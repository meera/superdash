This is a real time food ordering system. 
Think about DoorDasher with a RealTime Twist.
You can invite group of people and order food collaboratively.

As a group leader, you can start a group food order. 
You can share the URL with others and other users can join in your session.
Once user join-in, they can add their food order to main order. 
All users will see each others food order - and can collaborate on picking up food.
Once everybody is done, you can place the order.
