This is a real time food ordering system. 
Think about DoorDasher with a RealTime Twist.
You can invite group of people and order food collaboratively.

As a group leader, you can start a group food order. 
You can share the URL with others and other users can join in your session.
Once user join-in, they can add their food order to main order. 
All users will see each others food order - and can collaborate on picking up food.
Once everybody is done, you can place the order.


This hackathon coincided while I had Covid. I remember only two things during that time, 
- Ordering lots of greasy food 🍝 
- Coordinated food orders 🏘️ with others.  

This project aims to solve the problem of collaborative ordering 😊!

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash

## Why Collaborative Web Applications?
We all have used Google Docs, where users can collaborate to edit a document in real time. These multi-user, collaborative real-time applications are not new. Many online games and social media platforms implement it.. However,  this pattern is not widely adopted within the enterprise world.

Imagine an e-commerce application where users could collaborate to procure supplies in real-time without the need for an approval workflow. Or an employee performance evaluation portal, where all evaluators can share a common view and stack-rank bonuses. Or a system where two parties negotiate and agree on terms in real-time without the need for a centralized authority.. 
 
These peer-to-peer and distributed applications can be game-changing and will lead to innovative next-generation applications. The promise of Metaverse, where employees meet at the virtual world’s water cooler, seems too futuristic - However, real-time collaborative applications are achievable and buildable today.
