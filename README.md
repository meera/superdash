This is a real time food ordering system. 
Think about DoorDasher with a RealTime Twist.
You can invite group of people and order food collaboratively.

You can start a new group food order. Once you start an order, you share the URL with others and other users can join in your session.
Other users can add their food order to main order. 

All users will see each others food order - and can collaborate on picking up food.


This hackathon coincided while I had Covid. I remember only two things during that time, 
- Ordering lots of greasy food üçú
- Coordinated food orders with others.  

This project aims to solve the problem of collaborative ordering üòä!

## Why Collaborative Web Applications?
We all have used Google Docs, where users can collaborate to edit a document in real time. These multi-user, collaborative real-time applications are not new. Many online games and social media platforms implement it.. However,  this pattern is not widely adopted within the enterprise world.

Imagine an e-commerce application where users could collaborate to procure supplies in real-time without the need for an approval workflow. Or an employee performance evaluation portal, where all evaluators can share a common view and stack-rank bonuses. Or a system where two parties negotiate and agree on terms in real-time without the need for a centralized authority.. 
 
These peer-to-peer and distributed applications can be game-changing and will lead to innovative next-generation applications. The promise of Metaverse, where employees meet at the virtual world‚Äôs water cooler, seems too futuristic - However, real-time collaborative applications are achievable and buildable today.
